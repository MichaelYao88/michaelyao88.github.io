      The benefits of version control are that you're able to make changes without risking erasing previous work. You're also able to look at change history and roll it back to previous states. You're also able to work with others on multiple parts of a project using these tools
    </p>
    <p>
        git helps track changes by allowing for multiple branches or states to make adjustments to and then allows you to merge those with the master branch. There's also a history of changes made tracked in git.
    </p>
    <p>
        Github allows you to post your work remotely so that it's backed up and allows others to see and work on it as well. It also has a graphical interface that's pretty cool
